Python tools for cross stitching

These are tools for converting images to RGB arrays and also match up the colors to DMC thread colors. This is most useful for converting video game sprites to cross stitch patterns.

You might want to call right into the libraries.

You can call gen_html.py on the command line, giving it a image file on the command line. The resulting HTML will be written to standard output.
